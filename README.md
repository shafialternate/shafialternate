## Hello, I am Shafi!

I am studying Computer Science and Engineering since 2023.
So far I've taken ~20 courses in my university and among them I loved Discrete Mathematics, Data Structures and Algorithms, Algorithm Design and Analysis.

I love to code. I use JavaScript, TypeScript, Bash, and CPP on a regular basis. JavaScript is my first language and holds a special place in my heart.
